            My favorite movie is Star Wars: A New Hope. 
            An interesting fact that is well known about the movies is that the original movies were given prequels 20 years later.

            Star Wars: A New Hope was a start to a story about Luke Skywalker.
            He was the son of a very strong Jedi and he is now found himself on an adventure to fight the evil Sith.
            He meets a few people that help him out but must take on the biggest battle himself.
